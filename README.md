# Project Overview
This project involved the collection of real estate data from the 99acres website, encompassing information on flats and independent houses. The data was initially separated into two files, each undergoing individual cleaning processes to eliminate inconsistencies or inaccuracies. Following this, the datasets were merged, and feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance data quality and relevance.

# Data Analysis
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, involving both univariate and bivariate analyses to gain insights into the distribution and relationships within the dataset. Outliers were identified and appropriately addressed, and missing values were handled through imputation or removal as needed.

# Model Selection
In the final stage, a model selection process was executed. A pipeline was implemented, considering various machine learning algorithms. The models were evaluated for performance to identify the most suitable one for the given dataset. This comprehensive analysis is pivotal for making informed decisions and extracting valuable insights from the real estate data collected from 99acres.

# Streamlit Web Application
#ðŸŽ“ Price Predictor: Integrated a machine learning model into the application, allowing users to input property details and receive instant price predictions.

ðŸ“Š Analytics Section: Included a dedicated section within the application where users can explore various visualizations like scatter plots, maps, and other charts, providing insights into the real estate market.

ðŸ’¡ Recommendation System: Added a recommendation feature that offers personalized flat recommendations based on user preferences, enhancing the user's property search experience.

This all-in-one Streamlit application provides users with a one-stop solution for real estate data analysis, price estimation, data visualization, and property recommendations, making it a powerful tool for informed decision-making in the housing market.
